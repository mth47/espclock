### **Notes:**
1.	This clock does not require internet access.
	Depending on the enabled services (e.g. NTP, OPC, Blync) different ports are opened and connections established.
	In case the local router or any other device in the LAN can act as ntp server and OPC and Blynk disabled 
	no incoming or outgoing internet access is needed.
2.	The first start and every subsequent start where no WLAN connection can be established, the clock will start its own
	Access Point presenting the configuration page.
	If need be, the configuration Access Point can be triggered at any time via the clock's webserver plus a hardware reset.
