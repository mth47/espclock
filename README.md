### **Todo:**

*	second pulse in one of the unused leds, indvidual color or just red
*	Rainbow, dropping rain, falling snow, whatever

### **Fixed:**

*	Blynk and NTP reconnect after WLAN outage
*	Clock Display fix in case of disconnected WLAN
*	One common define for Small/Big Clock
*	Half To/Past Display fix
*	Reads older config file versions w/o cores :)
*	Wrong day/night switch at certain conditions

### **Note:**
		Without WLAN available during start-up an Access Point and the Configuration WebServer are started.
		Depending on the enabled service different ports are opened and/or connections established.
		In case the local router or any other device in the intranet can act as ntp server and OPC and Blynk functionality
		are disabled no incoming or outgoing internet access is required.
		If so, the configuration can only be changed having a web client being connected to the same local network. 
		For a clock this should be good enough.
